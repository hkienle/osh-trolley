## Preamble
This documents serves as overview and landing page to the more detailed design documents.

## Design

The frame is based on wooden [square bars](/@hkienle/part-square_bar) (:de: Quadratleisten) that can be readily purchased from a hardware store. The square bars are cut, drilled and connected with machine screws.
To understand the design principles, parts, and connectors study [frame-design](/@hkienle/frame-design/).

Furthermore, there is a axle/wheel suspension involving a connecting element for the wooden frame and axle, see [frame-wheel_mount](/@hkienle/frame-wheel_mount/).

## Design instantiations

:::success
:bulb: The design instantiations do not mandate each part precisely because many smaller variations may be equally applicable. For example, the length of a screw and the OD of a washer typically have acceptable ranges. Or a standard COTS part may be 3D-printed with a variation instead of purchased to spec.
:::

Instantiations of the design that narrow down the design space of parts and their dimensions:
- [frame-13x13](/@hkienle/frame-13x13)
- [frame-17x17](/@hkienle/frame-17x17)
- :construction: [frame-22x22](/@hkienle/frame-22x22)


All design instantiations have the same material choices (all wood), see [frame-material](/@hkienle/frame-material/).

You can rebuild an instantiation suggested above, modify one to your liking (please document and publish), or create a new instantiation alltogehter. To avoid confusion, a new instantiation must not invalidate the design principles.

## Builds

- [frame-build-skinny_3d](/@hkienle/frame-build-skinny_3d)
- [frame-build-sturdy_cots](/@hkienle/frame-build-sturdy_cots)

For a chosen design instantiation, each build is documented. The documentation
- specifies all parts unambiguously.
- describes the used tools and how they have been used.
:::success
:bulb: The build documentation references the design, resulting in a relatively terse parts spec.
