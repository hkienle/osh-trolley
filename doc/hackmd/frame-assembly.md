:rocket: If you are a proficient handyperson you do not need these instructions here, you can build straight from the [frame-design](/vnldW8TBSnO_LEm4tbxbGQ).

## Do

### Gather and organize parts

![image](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rJQ1qToTgg.png =x200)  
*Example of `build-17x17-sturdy_cots`*

- [ ] Make sure you have the correct number of beams.
- [ ] Order the beams based on length and make sure each beam has the correct length.
- [ ] Label each beam with its designation.

*Example of `build-17x17-sturdy_cots` (`fasteners-m4`)*

- [ ] Get screws, nuts and washers. Make sure you have the correct screw length (check against 2 beams).
- [ ] Make sure you have enough of each (you need more than you may think).

### Gather tools

![image](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/r1z51Rsael.png =x200)

- [ ] wrench(es) for nuts
- [ ] driver for screws
- [ ] hammer (with soft head) (optional)

### Assemble
- Do not fully tighten the connections during the assembly.
- You may even wait with fully tightening until the trolley is completed because you may have to (partially) re-assemble later for drilling extra holes, mounting add-ons, etc.

#### Timelapse (30x) of assembling the frame
- `design-17x17` `fastener-m4`
- Assembly with 17x17 beams and M4 fasteners, but this assembly is also applicable for other profiles and metric fasteners.

## :owl: Troubleshooting
- If a tri-joint does not quite fit, you can
    - try screwing in instead of pushing in.
    - use a hammer to force the screw.
    - ream out a hole or all holes.
- `screw-m4` If you don't have a 3mm hex drive, a torx TX-15 does the job as well. :face_with_finger_covering_closed_lips:
