## HackMD documents

All individual HackMD documents concerning the trolley are conveniently summarized in a HackMD book collection. 

[Visit the book collection](/@hkienle/osh-trolley-book) and then call up individual documents with the left pane.

**Legend for HackMD-Documents**
- :exclamation: Marks a hard constraint (e.g., a dimension) that must not be violated (or cannot be physically violated).
- :owl: recommended: Gives a recommendation (e.g., dimensional constraints) for a design or build. Not mandatory, but violate at your own risk.
- :book: Reference to another document that should be consulted first before proceeding.

:::info
**Asset names**
Each document has an id in the form `a-b-c` that labels the content of the document. It helps to quickly identify documents and how they relate to each other. It is probably mostly helpful for users that already have gained a rudimentary understanding of the document structure.  
**Standard sub-id strings**
- `proto` A prototype of some sorts. E.g., it could be a (scaled-down) miniature version of the envisioned (sub-)component or product that is mimicking some functionality.
- `assy` How to assemble parts into a (sub-)component or product. This assumes that all parts (given in the BOM) have been procured (`buy`), manufactured (`mfg`), or otherwise obtained.
- `mfg` How to **manufacture** a part.
- `reveng` **Reverse engineering** of a part, typically with the goal to understand the design and to extract measurements. In other words, our "`reveng`e" on the manufacturer that its product is closed source :smirk:.
- `build` A **physical build** of a (sub-)component or product, in other words an instantiation of a design. A build should be documented such that it enables replication
- `tn` A **technical note**, typically of a generic nature, but may be also project-specific.

**Project-specific sub-id strings**
- `frame` `wheel_mount` `bag` Sub-components of the trolley.
    - `13x13` etc. Frame profile with `s`=13mm.
- `book` A HackMD-style book (requires special formatting).
