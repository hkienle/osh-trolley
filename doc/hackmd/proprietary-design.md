## Large wheels
- :+1: More comfort, looks more robust.
- On *Reisenthel Citycruiser* wheels are detachable (for easier storage)!

## Stair-climbing wheels
- :+1: Seems a useful option to have.
- 3 wheels mounted on a "spider" instead of single wheel.
- Many commercial examples, it got very popular (no patent?).

## Integrated bag and frame
- :-1: Looks sleeks, but **not modular**. Repairability probably suffers.
- Bag integrates wheels and handle.
