## STEMFIE prototype

This 3D printed prototype leverages the [STEMFIE construction set](https://stemfie.org), which is close in spirit to Gridbeam and allows to readily "up-size" the prototype with wooden [square bars](/@hkienle/part-square_bar).

The goal for this prototype are to:
- get a haptic experience.
- represent all joints, especially tri-joints.
- represent all beams, screws and bolts (not washers).

### Deficiencies of the prototype
- The height (beams ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/2x-leg--back-light.svg)) is not modeled to scale because of size limits of the 3D printer (and to save on filament and print time).
- The wheel mount can not be readily transferred to a full-scale design (but may come close to a possible solution for larger beam profiles such as `frame-20x20`).
