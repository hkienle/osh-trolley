## Properties and constraints

The self-imposed (design) constraints of this build are:
- Primarily have **COTS parts**:
    - Ideally, a part associated with a norm/standard and many suppliers.
    - A part with several suppliers.
    - A part that can be purchased from a single supplier
- Use the [frame-17x17](/@hkienle/frame-17x17) design to better understand if there are structural problems for a "normal" use case.
- No 3D-printed parts.
- Feasible to build with:
    - simple hand tools
    - pillar drill (recommended for precision and convenience)

## Spec
- :exclamation: `design-17x17` <- `frame-design`

(For convenience, in the following some key specs are repeated.)

### Beam profile and fasteners
- `beam`: `s`=17mm
    - `beam-material`: pine (:de: Kiefer)
- `fastener-m4` (M4)
    - `screw-m4-40mm`
    - `nut-m4-flat`
        - `nut-m4-flat-height`=?
    - `washer-m4`
        - `washer-m4-dia`=16mm
        - `washer-m4-height`=1mm
    - `fastener-material`: zinc-plated, stainless steel (304)
